***Disclaimer: this project is a work in progress.***

This service exports various metrics from Ethereum clients for consumption by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). It uses [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) interface to collect the metrics. Any JSON-RPC 2.0 enabled client should be supported. Although, it was only tested with [Parity](https://wiki.parity.io/Parity-Ethereum).

## Usage

You can deploy this exporter using the [31z4/ethereum-prometheus-exporter](https://hub.docker.com/r/31z4/ethereum-prometheus-exporter/) Docker image.

    docker run -d -p 9368:9368 --name ethereum-exporter 31z4/ethereum-prometheus-exporter -url http://ethereum:8545

Keep in mind that your container needs to be able to communicate with the Ethereum client using the specified `url` (default is `http://localhost:8545`).

By default the exporter serves on `:9368` at `/metrics`. The listen address can be changed by specifying the `-addr` flag.

Here is an example [`scrape_config`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) for Prometheus.

```yaml
- job_name: ethereum
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - ethereum-exporter:9368
```

## Exported Metrics

| Name | Description | Labels |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| net_peer_count | The number of peers currently connected to the client. | |
| eth_block_number | The number of most recent block. | |
| eth_gas_price | The current price per gas in wei. *Might be inaccurate*. | |
| eth_block_transaction_count | The number of transactions in a block. | tag |
| eth_hashrate | The number of hashes per second that the node is mining with. | |
| eth_syncing | Data about the sync status. | block |

## Development

[Go modules](https://golang.org/doc/go1.11#modules) is used for dependency management. Hence Go 1.11 is a minimum required version.

[CircleCI Local CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/) can be used to ensure that everything builds locally.

    circleci build --job lint
    circleci build --job test
    circleci build --job build
